## Bibliography

This is a curated list of some numpy related resources (articles, books &
tutorials) addressing different aspects and requiring different levels.


### Articles

* [Python for Scientific Computing]
  (https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/cs/2007/03/c3010-abs.html)  
  Travis E. Oliphant, Computing in Science & Engineering, 9(3), 2007.
  
  > By itself, Python is an excellent "steering" language for scientific codes
  > written in other languages. However, with additional basic tools, Python
  > transforms into a high-level language suited for scientific and engineering
  > code that's often fast enough to be immediately useful but also flexible
  > enough to be sped up with additional extensions.
  

* [The NumPy array: a structure for efficient numerical computation]
  (https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00564007/document)  
  Stéfan van der Walt, Chris Colbert & Gael Varoquaux
  Computing in Science and Engineering, 13(2), 2011.
  
  > In the Python world, NumPy arrays are the standard representation for
  > numerical data and enable efficient implementation of numerical computations
  > in a high-level language. As this effort shows, NumPy performance can be
  > improved through three techniques: vectorizing calculations, avoiding copying
  > data in memory, and minimizing operation counts.
  
* [Vectorised algorithms for spiking neural network simulation]
  (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.397.6097)  
  Romain Brette	& Dan F. M. Goodman
  Neural Computation, 23(6), 2010.
  
  > High-level languages (Matlab, Python) are popular in neuroscience because
  > they are flexible and accelerate development. However, for simulating spiking
  > neural networks, the cost of interpretation is a bottleneck. We describe a
  > set of algorithms to simulate large spiking neural networks efficiently with
  > high-level languages using vector-based operations. These algorithms
  > constitute the core of Brian, a spiking neural network simulator written in
  > the Python language. Vectorized simulation makes it possible to combine the
  > flexibility of high-level languages with the computational efficiency usually
  > associated with compiled languages.

### Books

* [Elegant SciPy: The Art of Scientific Python]
  (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038481.do)  
  Juan Nunez-Iglesias, Stéfan van der Walt, Harriet Dashnow, O'Reilly, 2016.

  > Welcome to Scientific Python and its community! With this practical book,
  > you'll learn the fundamental parts of SciPy and related libraries, and get
  > a taste of beautiful, easy-to-read code that you can use in practice. More
  > and more scientists are programming, and the SciPy library is here to help.
  > Finding useful functions and using them correctly, efficiently, and in
  > easily readable code are two very different things. You'll learn by example
  > with some of the best code available, selected to cover a wide range of
  > SciPy and related libraries—including scikit-learn, scikit-image, toolz,
  > and pandas.

* [Guide to NumPy]
  (http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/courses/nlp/Software/NumPyBook.pdf)  
  Travis Oliphant, 2006
  
  > This book only briefly outlines some of the infrastructure that surrounds
  > the basic objects in NumPy to provide the additional functionality
  > contained in the older Numeric package (i.e. LinearAlgebra, RandomArray,
  > FFT). This infrastructure in NumPy includes basic linear algebra routines,
  > Fourier transform capabilities, and random number generators. In addition,
  > the f2py module is described in its own documentation, and so is only
  > briefly mentioned in the second part of the book.
  
* [IPython Interactive Computing and Visualization Cookbook]
  (https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-ipython-interactive-computing-and-data-visualization-sec)  
  Cyrille Rossant, Packt Publishing, 2015.
  
  > This book is a beginner-friendly guide to the Python data analysis
  > platform. After an introduction to the Python language, IPython, and the
  > Jupyter Notebook, you will learn how to analyze and visualize data on
  > real-world examples, how to create graphical user interfaces for image
  > processing in the Notebook, and how to perform fast numerical computations
  > for scientific simulations with NumPy, Numba, Cython, and ipyparallel. By
  > the end of this book, you will be able to perform in-depth analyses of all
  > sorts of data.
