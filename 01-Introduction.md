### About the author <a name="about"></a>

Nicolas P. Rougier is a full-time research scientist at Inria which is the
French national institute for research in computer science and control. This is
a public scientific and technological establishment (EPST) under the double
supervision of the Research & Education Ministry, and the Ministry of Economy
Finance and Industry. Nicolas P. Rougier is working within the Mnemosyne
project which lies at the frontier between integrative and computational
neuroscience in association with the Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases,
the Bordeaux laboratory for research in computer science (LaBRI), the
University of Bordeaux and the national center for scientific research (CNRS).
  
He has been using Python for more than 15 years and Numpy for more than 10
years (approximately) for modeling in Neuroscience, machine learning and for
advanced visualization (OpenGL). Of course, you can have 10 or 15 years
experience in something and still have no clue on how things work. However,
Nicolas is the author of several online resources and tutorials (Matplotlib,
Numpy, OpenGL) that have became references in the scientific community. He's
also teaching Python, Numpy and scientific visualization at the University of
Bordeaux and in various conferences worldwide (SciPy, EuroScipy, etc). He's
also the author of the popular article "Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures".

### Why another book on Numpy ? <a name="why"></a>

There is already a fair number of book about Numpy (see bibliography) and a
legitimate question is to wonder if another book is really necessary. As you
may have guessed by reading these lines, my personal answer is yes, mostly
because I think there's room for a different approach concentrating on the
migration from Python to Numpy through vectorization. There is actually a lot
of techniques that you don't find in books and such techniques are mostly
learned through experience. The goal of this book is to explain some of them
and to make you acquire experience.

This book is freely available on the web via github as well as through my
homepage. A paper version can be bought if you really hate trees but if you
really insist on giving me some money, consider buying an electronic version
instead. Or buy a paper book but plant a tree and/or eat a beaver...

### Pre-requisites <a name="pre-requisites"></a>

This is not a beginner guide.  
You should have an intermediate level in both Python and Numpy.  
If you're an advanced user, you'll be bored to death.

### Resources <a name="resources"></a>

* Command-line documentation
* Online documentation
* Online tutorials
* Mailing lists
* Stack overflow
* Conferences (SciPy, EuroSciPy, SciPy India)
* Books / Tutorial / Articles
* Contributing to Numpy

### Conventions <a name="conventions"></a>

We'll use usual naming conventions. If not stated explicitely, each script
should import numpy, scipy and matplotlib as:
  
    import numpy as np
    import scipy as sp
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
